# SpiderJump  - Spider'21 App Dev Hackathon

Implement a 2D canvas-based game with the following features:
Given a ball, you will have to construct walls approaching it in any speed, 
the ball must bounce over the walls on tapping the screen. Score is 
counted as the time taken till the ball hits the wall, store the scores in a 
leader board.
(To visualize better, this is similar to chrome Dinosaur game).
